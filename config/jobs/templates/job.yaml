# Copy and rename the file to create a new job.
# One file per job is required.
# The configuration file must be in YAML format and follow the structure below.
# The file should be named according to the job name (e.g., "my_job.yaml").

# Job-specific settings
job_name: "My Documents"  # The name of the backup job (used for logging and organization)
source: "/home/user/Documents"  # The source directory to back up
destination: "/path/to/local/storage"  # The destination directory for local backups

# Backup retention and size settings
keep_sets: 2  # Number of backup sets to retain (older sets will be deleted automatically)
max_tarball_size: 1024  # Maximum size of each tarball in MB (e.g., 1024 MB = 1 GB)

# GPG symmetric encryption for tarballs
encryption:
  enabled: true         # Default, false can be overridden by CLI
  method: gpg            # Only 'gpg' supported for now
  passphrase_env: JABS_ENCRYPT_PASSPHRASE  # Name of env var holding passphrase

  # Advanced patterns
  - "__pycache__/"  # Exclude all `__pycache__` directories at any level

# AWS S3 settings (for cloud backups)
  # Bucket name rules:
  # - Must be globally unique across all AWS accounts.
  # - Must be between 3 and 63 characters long.
  # - Can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
  # - Must start and end with a letter or number.
  # - Cannot contain uppercase letters or underscores.
  # - Cannot be formatted as an IP address (e.g., 192.168.5.4).
aws:
  profile: "default"  # AWS CLI profile to use (default if not specified)
  region: "us-east-1"  # AWS region (overrides profile region if specified)
  bucket: "my-bucket"  # S3 bucket name (required for cloud backups)

# --- Scheduling ---
# Define when and how backups should run automatically.
# Requires adding the scheduler.py script to the system crontab (e.g., by running `crontab -e`).
#
# Example Crontab Entry (runs every hour):
# This example assumes your Python virtual environment is located at /path/to/your/app/venv
# and the application is at /path/to/your/app/
# Adjust paths as necessary for your setup.
#
# 0 * * * * /path/to/your/app/venv/bin/python /path/to/your/app/scheduler.py
#
# Explanation:
#   0 * * * * : Run at minute 0 of every hour, every day, every month, every day of the week.
#   /path/to/your/app/venv/bin/python : Path to the Python interpreter inside your virtual environment.
#   /path/to/your/app/scheduler.py : Path to the JABS scheduler script.
#
# Cron Syntax:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |                          Both 0 and 7 represent Sunday in many cron versions for historical reasons. 0 is standard.
# *  *  *  *  *
schedules:
  - cron: "0 2 * * 7"  # Minute 0, Hour 2 (2:00 AM), Any Day of Month, Any Month, Day of Week 7 (Sunday)
    # Runs every Sunday at 2:00 AM
    type: "full"       # full or diff
    sync: true         # Sync to S3 after backup, true or false
    enabled: false      # Set to false to disable this schedule

  - cron: "0 2 * * 1-6" # Minute 0, Hour 2 (2:00 AM), Any Day of Month, Any Month, Day of Week 1 through 6 (Monday to Saturday)
    # Runs every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at 2:00 AM
    type: "diff"       # Run a differential backup
    sync: false        # Do not sync differential backups by default
    enabled: false     # This schedule is active

# Example disabled schedule:
#  - cron: "0 0 1 * *"  # Minute 0, Hour 0 (midnight), Day of Month 1, Any Month, Any Day of Week
#    # Runs on the 1st day of every month at midnight (00:00)
#    type: "full"
#    sync: true
#    enabled: false     # This schedule is currently inactive

# Notes:
# - Ensure the `source` directory exists and contains the files you want to back up.
# - The `destination` directory must have sufficient space for the backup sets.
# - The `aws` section is required only if you plan to sync backups to AWS S3.
# - Use the `exclude` list to specify files or directories to skip during the backup process.
# - Advanced examples for `exclude`:
#   - "**/temp/**": Excludes all directories named `temp` at any level of the directory tree.
#   - "**/*.log": Excludes all `.log` files recursively in all subdirectories.
#   - "**/*.tmp": Excludes all `.tmp` files recursively in all subdirectories.
#   - "**/backup_*/": Excludes all directories starting with `backup_` at any level.
#   - "**/202*/": Excludes all directories with names starting with `202` (e.g., year-based directories).
#   - "**/*.{jpg,png,gif}": Excludes all image files with `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.gif` extensions.
#   - "**/!(important).txt": Excludes all `.txt` files except those named `important.txt` (requires extended globbing).
#   - "**/logs/**/debug.log": Excludes `debug.log` files in any `logs` subdirectory.
#   - "**/!(keep_this_dir)/": Excludes all directories except `keep_this_dir` (requires extended globbing).
